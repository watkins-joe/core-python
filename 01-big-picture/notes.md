# big picture

## summary

this course was a basic introductory big picture/high-level overview of python and its similarities and differences to other languages

## notable features:
* dynamically typed
  * meaning the types of data variables can store can be changed at any time and are not required to be explicitly/statically typed upon initialization. examples of statically typed languages include Java and C.
* interpreted
  * the source code in an **interpreted** language is not directly translated by the targeted machine. instead, an **interpreter** reads and executes the code instead.
* garbage-collected
  * memory is managed for us automatically. javascript is also garbage-collected.
* high-level
  * meaning that the language is much closer to human language and further from computer language, or machine code. **low-level** languages provide little to no abstraction from computer language and whose commands or functions map closely to processor instructions. examples of low-level languages include C and assembly.
* general purpose
  * a language that can be utilized broadly across many application domains and use-cases


## other notes

* emphasizes **readability** with the use of indentation to signify code blocks. the indentations and number of indentations are very important

* python is not a C-styled language, meaning that it doesn't make use of the angle brackets `{}` used in C-styled languages such as Java, JavaScript, or PHP.
